This GIT repo is simply a place for me to maintain the source code I use to drive http://www.modeltraintracker.com .   The site will be open soon as a subscription service (US$5/month) for model railroad enthusiasts to maintain a detailed inventory of their collection.

The site is powered by:
PHP - http://www.php.net/
MySQL - http://www.mysql.com/
JQuery - http://www.jquery.com/ 
JQueryUI - http://www.jqueryui.com/
JQuery Validation - http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
DataTables - http://www.datatables.net/
DataTables Editable - http://code.google.com/p/jquery-datatables-editable/

Special thanks to all the developers for their excellent software and solutions.
